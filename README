creaturebox
Make creature spawners tradable
Version 0.7.3

creaturebox fixes several issues with creature spawners, so that they can be altered, and traded between players.

Features:
* When a creature spawner is broken, it is dropped as an item.
* When a creature spawner is placed, it retains its original creature type.
* The creature type which is created by a creature spawner can be changed using the /creaturebox set command. To alter a mob spawner, look directly at it (through glass is fine), then type /creaturebox set {creaturename}, where {creaturename} is the name of a creature. Valid creature names are: pig, chicken, cow, sheep, squid, creeper, ghast, pig_zombie, skeleton, spider, zombie, slime, monster, giant and wolf.
* The frequency at which a creature spawner generates creatures can be changed using the /creaturebox period {period} command, where {period} is the number of seconds between spawns. A period of -1 gives a random period between 10 and 20 seconds. A period of zero puts the creature spawner into "pulsed redstone" mode, where creatures are generated only when the redstone power of the spawner switches from high to low.
* The number of creatures generated at a time can be changed using the /creaturebox count {count} command, where {count} is the number of creatures to generate. A count of -1 generates a random number of creatures (from 1 to 4), while a count of 0 disables the spawner.
* The maximum number of live mobs that a spawner will maintain can be changed using the /creaturebox limit {limit} command, where {limit} is the desired maximum. A limit of -1 sets the default, which is 10 for a managed spawner, and unknown for a natural spawner.
* The requirements for spawning a creature can be adjusted using the /creaturebox requires {requirements} command, where {requirements} is a space separated list any number of:
        player - require a player to be within 20 blocks of the spawner.
        surface - require grass for critters.
        light - require light for critters, dark for monsters.
* A creature spawner's settings can be displayed using the /creaturebox info command.
* A creature spawner can be given to a player using the /creaturebox give {player} {creaturename} {count} command.
* Supports the Permissions API. If Permissions (or GroupManager/FakePermissions) is not available, uses the player's Op status to determine its behavior.
* A creature spawner can be turned off by powering it with redstone. Note: this will not affect the spawning of invincible "Ghost pigs".
